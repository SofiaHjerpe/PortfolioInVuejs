  <div class="about">
    <p>My name is Sofia and I am 24 years old. In the summer of 2022, I took my bachelor's degree from the ICT, media and design program at Södertörn University. During my education I learned more about programming. I have worked at Wellfish as a Junior Frontend developer. During my time at Wellfish, I learned more about structuring code. I also learned more about design and User experience. During my time at Wellfish, I learned more about the programming languages Vue.js, CSS, HTML, Javascript and Typescript. I also got to learn about Figma and CMS. I chose to quit working at Wellfish because I wanted a job with more collaboration.

    <p>On my free time I like to dance salsa and be with friends and family. Now I'm taking a course called "Programmering fortsättning" at Distansakademin. In the course I learn about the following programming languages; C#, HTML, Javascript, .Net Core WebAPI/MVC, Entity framework, Node js and Vue.js.</p>
      <br />
    <p>In my studies at Södertörn University I learned about User interaction design, User interfaces and User friendly design. I made a website to my uncle. When making the website to my uncle I followed the Design thinking process. The Design thinking process consist of 5 elements. Empathy phase, Define phase, Idea generation phase, Prototyping phase and Iteration phase. For example I used the Prototyping phase by making a Hifi-prototype in Figma. I also used the Iteration phase by having contact with my uncle during the process. 
     To see my projects go to "Projects". </p>

    <p> I'm open for jobs as a UX/UI designer and as a Junior Frontend developer. If you are interested you are very welcome to contact me at; sofia.hjerpe@yahoo.com or send a message to Linkedin at @Sofia Hjerpe.
